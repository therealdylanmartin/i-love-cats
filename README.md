## Week 1

I needed to showcase semantic HTML and introductory CSS properties to beginning programmers.

I did this by structuring the index.html file with the proper HTML elements and bringing in alternative text for images, as well as adding a few aria-label attributes. This highlights web content accessibility and SEO.

I created a number of CSS styles to complete my goal of creating a presentable webpage. Some advanced properties not yet taught have been used to demonstrate further capabilities.
